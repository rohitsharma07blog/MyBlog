# Decentralized Water Governance in India:
# Successes, Gaps &amp; the Way Forward.

Abstract: India is facing a mounting water crisis characterized by over-extraction of
groundwater, contamination of surface water sources, increasing variability in rainfall
patterns, and growing demands from _agriculture, _industry, and **domestic **sectors.

These challenges are compounded by institutional fragmentation and inefficiencies
in top-down governance models, which often fail to address the needs and
complexities at the local level. In this context, decentralized water governance has
emerged as a compelling alternative to centralized planning and decision-making,
offering greater potential for participatory, responsive, and sustainable management
of water resources.

1. Introduction
Water is not just a basic human necessity but a vital resource that underpins
agricultural productivity, industrial growth, and ecological stability. In India, however,
this resource is under severe stress. The country is home to 18% of the world’s
population but has only 4% of its freshwater resources. Per capita water availability
has declined drastically over the past few decades due to population growth,
pollution, climate variability, and poor management. Groundwater—the backbone of
India’s irrigation and drinking water supply—is being extracted at unsustainable
rates, while many rivers remain heavily polluted. Cities are struggling with erratic
water supply, and rural areas face both scarcity and quality issues.

Traditionally, India had a strong legacy of community-based water management,
ranging from tank systems in the south to stepwells in the west and canal networks
in the north. These systems were tailored to local ecology and governed by social
norms and collective responsibilities. However, over the past century, centralized
models—characterized by large dams, bureaucratic control, and one-size-fits-all
policies—have overshadowed these indigenous systems. While these projects
brought benefits in terms of irrigation expansion and drinking water access, they also
created exclusion, environmental degradation, and dependency on state machinery.
In recent decades, decentralization has gained policy attention as a way to revive
local stewardship, improve service delivery, and democratize water governance. The
73rd and 74th Amendments to the Constitution were landmark reforms that gave
formal powers to local institutions such as Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) and
Urban Local Bodies (ULBs). These institutions are now responsible for managing
water supply, sanitation, and water conservation at the village and municipal levels.
Alongside this, civil society organizations, NGOs, and community-based groups have
played a crucial role in mobilizing citizens and fostering participatory governance.
Decentralized water governance holds immense promise because it allows decisions
to be made closer to the point of implementation. It encourages stakeholder
participation, context-sensitive solutions, and accountability mechanisms that are
often lacking in centralized models. However, the transition is not without challenges.
Local institutions frequently lack technical expertise, financial autonomy, and access
to data. Policy fragmentation, inter-departmental silos, and weak monitoring systems
further complicate effective implementation.
This paper sets out to explore this complex yet hopeful terrain. By examining
historical trajectories, current policies, successful grassroots initiatives, and global
partnerships like the Indo-Dutch cooperation, it aims to provide a nuanced
understanding of what works, what doesn’t, and what needs to change. In doing so,
it underscores the urgent need for a paradigm shift in water governance—one that
centers local communities, fosters equity, and embraces adaptive and sustainable
practices in the face of a growing water crisis.

2. Evolution of Water Governance in India
Water governance in India reflects the country’s vast historical depth, diverse
ecological landscapes, and evolving political economy. It has traversed a fascinating
journey—from community-led management systems rooted in traditional wisdom
to centralized state control, and, more recently, a move towards decentralized

and participatory governance. Each phase of this evolution has left a distinct
imprint on the way water is perceived, used, and governed in the country today.

2.1 Pre-Independence Era: Traditional Wisdom and Community-Based
Management
Before the advent of British rule, water was considered a sacred, shared resource
managed largely through customary laws and collective practices. Local
communities across India had developed sophisticated, decentralized water
management systems finely tuned to regional climatic and geographical conditions.
These systems were both technologically innovative and socially embedded,
ensuring equity, sustainability, and resilience.
Some prominent examples include:
 Kuhls of Himachal Pradesh: Mountain stream channels constructed and
maintained by local communities, used for irrigation and domestic needs.
 Tank systems of South India: Intricately linked tanks and ponds used for
agriculture, rainwater harvesting, and recharging groundwater. These were
governed by temple institutions or village panchayats.
 Ahar-Pyne system in Bihar: A dual system of catchment-based tanks
(ahars) and channels (pynes), enabling efficient irrigation in flood-prone
plains.
 Stepwells (Vavs/Baolis) in Gujarat and Rajasthan: Ingenious architectural
feats serving both water and social functions, especially in arid zones.
 Zabo and Apatani systems in the Northeast: Integrated models of forest,
water, and agriculture management by indigenous tribes.
These practices were deeply participatory, guided by moral obligations,
customary norms, and socio-religious values. Maintenance responsibilities were
often rotated among villagers or assigned to hereditary water custodians (e.g.,
neerkatti in Tamil Nadu). Water sharing disputes were resolved through community
deliberations, not external enforcement.
The British colonial administration, however, viewed these systems as informal and
non-revenue-generating. With a focus on land revenue and economic extraction,
traditional systems were neglected or dismantled. The colonial state promoted large-
scale canal irrigation systems, such as the Upper Ganga Canal (1854), prioritizing
cash crops and favoring specific regions, especially Punjab and the Indo-Gangetic
plain. This marked the erosion of local water autonomy and the beginning of state
control over water resources.

2.2 Post-Independence Period (1947–1990): Centralization, Dams, and the
Technocratic Paradigm
In the decades following independence, water governance became synonymous with
nation-building and modernization. Inspired by the Soviet model and guided by
Nehruvian socialism, the Indian state took upon itself the task of transforming
nature to fuel development. This period witnessed a dramatic shift from
community management to large-scale, centrally controlled infrastructure.
Key features of this phase:
 Mega dam projects such as Bhakra Nangal, Hirakud, Sardar Sarovar, and
Damodar Valley were constructed as &quot;temples of modern India.&quot;
 The emphasis was on flood control, irrigation, hydropower generation,
and urban water supply, often ignoring local ecological knowledge and
community participation.
 The role of centralized bureaucracies like the Central Water Commission
(CWC) and State Irrigation Departments expanded, sidelining local bodies.
While these projects contributed to food security (Green Revolution),
industrialization, and infrastructure growth, they also led to:
 Displacement of millions without adequate rehabilitation.
 Ecological damage due to alteration of river flows and submergence of
forests and habitats.
 Gendered and social exclusion, as decision-making remained top-down
and technical, with limited participation from women, tribals, and
small/marginal farmers.
During this phase, water was viewed as an instrument of economic growth, rather
than a common property resource. Community water systems either declined or
were absorbed into state systems, often becoming dysfunctional due to lack of local
ownership._italic_
